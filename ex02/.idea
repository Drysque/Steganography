------ Follow Ditto ?
--- To capture Ditto, you must hunt him throughout the map as he transforms.
--- He will be located in the first Gym, in the Portable Document Format room. Open the door, remember the code. Ditto will escape, so leave the room.
--- Follow him as he hides as a picture. Steal the Upside-Down relic. Ditto takes an humanoid form and runs away.
--- An old man will spawn in The Born Again City. This is Ditto disguised but the quest is locked until you solve his enigma. Use the previously acquired relic to solve it.
--- Stay in this city and use the Transform Well. First, throw the answer to the enigma, then the code from the room in the starting Gym. When you were occupied, his trainer found him and took him back to his place.
--- Salvage the parchment in the well and follow the trainer to the Archives. He will close the doors but use the parchment to open them. The old trainer lost the credentials to his PC. Find them and steal Ditto.
-- DO AT THE END

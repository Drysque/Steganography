--- To capture Ditto, you must hunt him throughout the map as he transforms.
--- He will be located in the first Gym, in the Portable Document room. Open the door, remember the code. Ditto will escape, so leave the room.
--- Follow him as he hides as a picture. Steal the Upside-Down relic. Ditto takes an humanoid form and runs away once again.
--- An old man will spawn in The Born Again City. This is Ditto transformed but the quest is locked until you open the previously acquired relic. Find the key and crack the relic.
--- While you were occupied, his trainer found him and called him back. Follow him to the Archives. He will close the doors, but use the code from the first room to open them.
--- Once in, the old trainer will ask you for help; he lost the credentials to his PC station. Use the opened relic to hack in and steal the ownership of Ditto from him.
-- DO AT THE END
